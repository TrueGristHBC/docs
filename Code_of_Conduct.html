  <h2>Complaints</h2>
  <p>Code of Conduct complaints should be reported to a member of the <a href="https://truegrist.ca/executive/">Club Executive</a>, who will bring it to the Club President. A Code of Conduct investigation will be undertaken, and based on the results of that investigation, appropriate action will be determined. Anonymous complaints are accepted with the understanding that direct follow up will not be possible, and the ability to conduct an investigation may be affected.</p>
  
  <h2>Feedback</h2>
  <p>The Club's Code of Conduct is continually open to feedback for improvement. Please contact the <a href="https://truegrist.ca/executive/">Club President</a> with any such feedback.
