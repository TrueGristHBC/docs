<br>
<h2>Parts list</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 fruit crusher</li>
    <li>1 wooden crusher hopper handle</li>
    <li>12 pressing blocks (assorted sizes)</li>
    <li>2 pressing plates</li>
    <li>1 ratchet handle bar</li>
    <li>2 ratchet pawls</li>
    <li>1 press stand</li>
    <li>1 ratchet</li>
    <li>2 basket halves</li>
    <li>6 basket pins</li>
    <li>1 tube of lubricant</li>

<br>
<h2>Fruit Crusher</h2>
<h3>Warnings and recommendations</h3>
<ul>
<li>Do not put any body parts in the crusher while it is in use.</li>
<li>Do not run fruit with pits through the crusher without removing the pits first.</li>
<li>Do not use any power tools to operate the crusher.</li>
<li>When using the crusher for apples you it is recommended that the apples be halved or quartered for ease of use.</li>
<li>Use of pectic enzyme with crushed fruit can improve juice yields (not provided).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Operation</h3>
<ol>
<li>Give the crusher a quick rinse with water to clean off any dirt or dust from storage.</li>
<li>Place the crusher over a sturdy collection vessel such as a bucket of bin. Besure the vessel can withstand some downward weight as you will need to push down on the crusher to ensure it does not move. Optionally you can use clamps to secure the crusher.</li>
<li>Fill the hopper with fruit and install the wooden crossbar on the top of the hopper.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Cleaning</h3>
<ol>
<li>Crank the handle of the crusher to start pulping the fruit.</li>
<li>Wash entire unit with hot soapy water using the soap provided. Ensure all debris has been removed.</li>
<li>Rinse with clean water, and dry all parts thoroughly</li>
<li>Apply lubricant if needed</li>
</ol>
<br>
<h2>Fruit Press</h2>
<h3>Warnings and recommendations</h3>
<ul>
<li>The fruit press is very heavy, move with multiple people using proper lifting technique to avoid injury.</li>
<li>All fruit should be crushed prior to pressing to obtain reasonable yield</li>
<li>You may wish to press fruit in a muslin or nylon bag (not provided) to simplify cleanup and reduce pulp material in juice. Alternatively or additionally you may wish to strain juice as it is being collected.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Operation</h3>
<ol>
<li>Before assembling and operating the press, rinse all parts to remove any dust or dirt from storage.</li>
<li>If needed, lubricate moving parts and hinges with lubricant provided.</li>
<li>Place a clean, sanitized container under the spout to collect the juices.</li>
<li>Fill the basket with the fruit to be pressed.</li>
<li>Arrange the half circle pressing plates on top of the fruit.</li>
<li>Place two of the wooden pressing blocks on top of the pressing plates on either side of the screw. Lay them crossways/perpendicular to the seam of the pressing plates. Stack the next two pressing blocks on top of the first set. Lay them perpendicular to the first set. If the basket is not completely full, more blocks can be used as needed. Just alternate directions with each layer as you go.</li>
<li>Screw on the ratchet head clockwise, down the screw until the lower plate of the ratchet head is snug against the top of the blocks.</li>
<li>Insert the two ratchet pawls (angled metal bars) into the two slots on top of ratchet head. The pawls are what allow the ratchet head to spin down the screw as you crank the pole back-and-forth. Each pawl must be put in each slot correctly for the ratcheting action to work. Insert the key into the slot closest to you with the point of it going down and to the left. The one furthest from you should be pointing down and to the right.</li>
<li>Insert the handle and begin cranking. Please note that the ratcheting action will not work until the ratchet head is met with sufficient resistance. Crank until sufficient juice is flowing and then stop! Wait for the flow to slow down, then start cranking again to increase the flow. Use this crank and wait approach until no more juice is attainable.</li>
<li>To back-off the ratchet head, reverse the directions of the keys and crank the handle until the pressure is released.</li>
<li>Remove the spent pulp by breaking the basket away from the press. To do this pull out the pins on the side of the basket and it will then be free to come apart.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Cleaning</h3>
<ol>
<li>Remove the ratchet from the screw. Wipe with a damp cloth if it has become soiled.</li>
<li>Remove the pins from the basket and separate them in half. Clean the cages in hot soapy water, using the soap provided. A soft brush (not provided) may be used to remove debris from between the slats</li>
<li>Also wash the base, screw, pressing-plate and blocks in hot soapy water.</li>
<li>Rinse everything with clean water, and dry all parts thoroughly.
