<ol>
<li>True Grist (TG) equipment may only be rented by current TG Full Members.</li>
<li>All TG equipment rentals are subject to a security deposit, which will be returned in full to the Renter following full compliance to the Rentals Terms and Conditions, as determined by TG Equipment Director or the TG Executive. The security deposit amount will be indicated on each equipment rental information page.</li>
<li>An equipment inspection will be conducted by a TG Executive Member with the Renter prior to the issuing of the equipment. Beyond failures due to normal wear and tear, if equipment is damaged while in the Renter’s possession, it is their responsibility to:
<ol>
<li>report the damage immediately to the TG Equipment Director, and,</li>
<li>cover the full costs of any required repairs/replacement as determined by TG Equipment Director.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>All equipment will be returned in a clean and sanitary state. Cleaning supplies and instructions will be provided and must be strictly followed. Equipment that is not returned in this state will result in a cleaning fee applied against the security deposit, followed by a review of the offending Member’s rental privileges. The cleaning fee will be indicated on each equipment rental information page.</li>
<li>All equipment rentals must be booked at least 2 weeks in advance, and will not exceed 5 days in duration unless otherwise agreed upon with the TG Executive Member responsible for the item. All rental requests are processed on a first come first serve basis.</li>
<li>All equipment must be returned on the predetermined return date unless otherwise discussed with the TG Executive Member responsible for the item. Failure to do so will result in a late fee applied against the security deposit, and a review of the offending Member’s rental privileges. The late fee will be indicated on each equipment rental information page.</li>
<li>TG equipment is to be used at one’s own risk. TG maintains no liability for any injuries or harm that may come from using or cleaning the rental equipment.</li>
